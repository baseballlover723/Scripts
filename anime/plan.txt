Plan to make scripts more maintainable
Goal: extract out common functionality into seperate files, and reuse it

TODO Create Base script
    TODO Create Common Base Classes (ShowGroup?, Show, Seasons, Episode)
    TODO Create Common iteration
    TODO Create common caching layer (file based? or sqllite based?) (not all scripts use the cache)
    TODO Hookpoints: analyze episode, trim results, print results, analyze season?, analyze show?
    TODO Handle comparing scripts, (making multiple iterations kept seperate)

TODO Create Args File (path info and what not) that the scripts read from
